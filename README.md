# BringOUtYourDead

This noe works in 42.6 but the speed keep is broken now. You'll have to fast forward after laying down a zombie every time until I can figure this one out.

This mod DOES NOT WORK on the previous build 42.5

Bring Out Your Dead!

Recent Updates:
Add a Safety Toggle to ignore zombies while moving corpses
You shouldn't be stuck in fast forward now. When the bodies are dealt with, it will default to whatever your "Resume normal speed" accessibility option is set at
Added a color picker to change the color of the selection outline
Auto Move option will now only appear when right clicking on a corpse
You can find corpses in the basement now

Right-Click on a dead zombie, choose Auto Move Corpses and:
Move All Corpses - When outside, select a spot to put the dead and then select an area that includes the zombies you'd like to move. When inside, select a spot to store your corpses and this mod will take care of the rest.
Toggle Safety On/Off - Safety On will stop what you're doing if a zombie is near. Safety Off will ignore them. This saves to the player so if you die or start a new character, you'll need to choose again.
Choose Highlight Color - Change the color of the selection outline. This option saves to the player so if you die or start a new character, you'll need to choose again.


There are some things I am still working on:
If you are dragging a zombie and a short fence is in your path to the drop off, you will get stuck on the fence. PZ path finding does not account for short fences.
If you get stuck, just move and it will reset everything. Unless your frozen, then you'll need to reload the save. I'm working on it...
I haven't tried it, but if you're in a 32 story building or in the mall with 100's of dead and try to auto move them, something is bound to break.

Known Issues:
If a zombie is laying a certain way, you cannot pick it up. This is a game bug that I cannot fix. Hopefully they fix this in a future patch.
Your player may freeze with no way to move which requires a save reload. I believe it has something to do with objects under the corpses, but I can't confirm yet because it throws absolutely no errors.

If you think something else should be added, let me know!
